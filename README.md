# node-sandbox

## Getting started

Locate the terminal (or press Alt+T to open a new one). Type "npm install" and hit enter. This will install everything you need to get up and running.

If you're curious, "npm" is the Node Package Manager. It looks in the "package.json" file and installs all the dependencies that aren't already installed.

## Running the application

Open "server.js" and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

Once the app is running, open the project in the shape of "https://projectname-username.c9.io/" (e.g. "https://node-sandbox-aaronbrowder.c9.io/").

Also while the app is running, whenever you make a change to a template file (*.hbs), it will automatically compile. For this reason you should keep the app running while you are editing client files.
